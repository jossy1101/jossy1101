  <summary><h3>My Programming Journey </h3></summary>
  
  My programming journey started with an introductory class to C++ in my first year, followed by the upcoming semester was learning Java and Android development. After that, I took a course to taught Python and Git as part of the curriculum, and applied software design patterns to my Python applications. By the end of my first year, I had developed my first full application in Python and was just starting my second year to learning data structures and algorithms.  Following up the next semester I took a discrete mathematics class taught as a programming class. Where I learned implementing graph theory, set theory, etc. Which in my third I learned much more emphasis such as shell scripting, automation, build environments, etc.
